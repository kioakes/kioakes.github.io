## Cases

Here I will detail how to handle some of the cases which come in and explain what needs to be done, or who should be contacted regardsing these.

#### Blocked website

When someone has opened a case regarding a URL, the following should be checked:
- Can you access thsi site when you're not on the STH network (mobile phone for example?)
  - If no, the website is down. If this is a site STH own (for example XYZ.sth.nhs.uk) then identify whether a network outage is occuring or contact the responsible team.
- Verify whether other services on that IP are available (https://reverseip.domaintools.com Will show other sites associated with that IP)
- Check whether this is being blocked in FireSight (Worth asking a senior Engineer)

If none of the above are the issue, this site may be blocked by our ISP, Redcentric. If you suspect this, please complete the following steps:
- Email a request to 'support@redcentricplc.com', explaining your investigation suggests it may be filtered by them and copy in a senior network engineer.
  - If you are not Authorised, ask a senior engineer to request this from: Mark Dever m.dever@nhs.net
- Wait for the network change request form to be forwarded to yourself
