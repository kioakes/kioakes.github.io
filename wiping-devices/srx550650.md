## Juniper SRX Router wiping

Notes for resetting Juniper SRX 550/650:

1)	Connect from your laptop to the router using a console cable (Mini USB-B to com port or USB) and open the application putty.exe.

2)	When putty is open and the device is connected, select "serial" and choose the COM port being used to connect then click Open. If you are unsure on the COM port, please check device manager under "Ports (COM & LPT)"

3)	Once connected using putty, power on the device and press "SPACE" when prompted, this must be after the kernel has loaded. You'll know this has been sucsessful when you get the following output:
```

6.	Once the router has booted, please attempt to run the following command:
```
root@lon19-core> request system zeroize
warning: System will be rebooted and may not boot without configuration
Erase all data, including configuration and log files? [yes,no] (no) yes

error: the ipsec-key-management subsystem is not running
warning: zeroizing node0
```
If the device requests a password, please try to use the username "root". Otherwise please power cycle the device and attempt this process again.
