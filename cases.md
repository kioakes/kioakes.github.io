## Cases

Here I will detail how to handle some of the cases which come in and explain what needs to be done, or who should be contacted regardsing these.

#### Blocked website

When someone has opened a case regarding a URL, the following should be checked:
- Can you access thsi site when you're not on the STH network (mobile phone for example?)
  - If no, the website is down. If this is a site STH own (for example XYZ.sth.nhs.uk) then identify whether a network outage is occuring. 

#### Other cases
